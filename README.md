# Energy-Consumption-Trends-in-Netherland
Data source: Kaggle
# INTRODUCTION
Liander NV is one of the leading energy provider in the cities of Netherlands. 
We worked on the dataset that includes the energy consumption information from year 2009 to 2019.
Our sponsor wants to plan for their production plant’s set up, spread up smart meters, enhance existing infrastructure and set up financial goals. 
# BUSINESS PROBLEM
How are the smart meters spreading?
What is the trend of energy consumption in the Netherlands over the years? 
We are asked to analyze the spread of smart meters and the trends of energy consumed by cities over the years

# About Dataset
CSV files from the year 2009 to 2019 for both electricity and gas. 
There are 15 variables in the dataset such as city, consumption, number of connections, smart meters, year and so on with about 2.5 million records in it.
Every file contains information about groups of zipcodes managed by one of the three companies for a specific year.

# Methodology
Microsoft Azure Service
Data Lake Storage Gen1 – For data storage.
Azure Databricks – Platform used to run code for preprocessing data. 
Microsoft Power BI – Used for making interactive illustrations. 

Programming Language
Python

Libraries
PySpark
NumPy
Pandas

# CONCLUSION
From our analysis, it can be inferred that the total electricity consumption has been roughly constant over the years except for their major city Amsterdam. 
While the number of connections growing linearly, so the consumption per connection in cities seemingly decreased. 
we have seen that number of smart meters have increased tremendously over the years which will help Liander if they will deploy more smart meters in Amsterdam followed with other cities in the Netherlands,
it will help them increasing their revenue.
This decision will also help them enhancing their infrastructure by saving energy, maintenance time and cost. 
With the help of these smart meters, every user can have control over energy consumption and save environment.
